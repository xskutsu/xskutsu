Welcome to my github profile! I'm passionate about all things .io games, especially the Arras.io/Diep.io ecosystem. You'll usually find me messing with game mechanics, reverse-engineering APIs, or trying to squeeze every last drop of performance of JS.

---
### 🔥 What I'm possibly cooking:
*   **Physics Engine Shenanigans:** Constantly iterating on my own custom 2D physics engine.
*   **Polymania:** My take on a diep.io spinoff game. Lots of exciting (and sometimes cursed) code happening here.
*   **Various Scripts & Tools:** Often making up userscripts, discord bots, or utilities for games I play.
---
### 🧱 My Tech Stack & Interests:
*   **Languages:** Primarily TypeScript & JavaScript (ES6+). I dabble in Rust and Go.
*   **Frontend/Game Dev:** Canvas API, WebGL, WebGPU, HTML, CSS.
*   **Backend:** Node.js. MySQL.
*   **Tools:** VS Code, Git, ~~Glitch~~, Heroku.
*   **Interests:** Game engine architecture, network protocols, performance optimization, procedural generation (maze, world, etc.), AI in games, community building. And occasionally, a bit of *devious trolling* for science.

### 🔰 I’m currently learning:
*   More about WebGPU and its potential for 2D rendering.
*   Advanced Rust for game development.
*   Javascript. Do you ever fully learn this language?

### 前にやった冒険 (stuff I did in the past):
*   Heavily involved in the Woomy Arras community (development, moderation, and navigating the occasional drama!).
*   Contributed to/forked numerous Arras.io private servers like Storma, Raxor, AJPlay'z arras, etc.
*   Lots of random small things, just check out my repositories!

### 💌 How to reach me:
*   Discord: `@xskt`
*   Email: `xsku@protonmail.com`
*   GitHub Issues on any of my repos!

### ✨ Fun Fact:
My brain is probably 70% arras.io source code mapping and 30% JS optimization hacks.
